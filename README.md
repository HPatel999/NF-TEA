# NF-TEA

The project we aim to put forward is a Web3
powered platform directed at content creators and
influencers. The web application will allow its users
to convert social media content from their Instagram
accounts into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These
will then be available for users to acquire and sell
as tradable assets, using Etherium (ETH) as a store
value.
MetaMaskâ€™s hot wallet functionalities will be
leveraged in order to provide users with the option
to interact and discharge their assets from our
platform. Purposed as such, the NFT platform
will create a convenient user experience in web
environments. It should also be light enough to
be used on most devices, from mobile devices to
desktop computers.
